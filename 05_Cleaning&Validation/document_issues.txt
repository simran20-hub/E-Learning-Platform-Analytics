1. Validating No. of rows in csv and database tables
- payments_table in database has 5565 rows while csv file has 5600. A total of 35 rows missing/not inserted in database

2. 1184 entires where payment timestamp is less than enrollment timestamp. denoting 1184 times payment was done before enrollment which is systematically not possible

Issue 1: 35 missing payment entries
This is the NaN status rows you dropped during cleaning. 
Document this as known data loss. No action needed now, but note it in your analysis
that payment data represents ~97.5% coverage.

Issue 2:  Since this is synthetic data, If the time difference is small (seconds/minutes),
assume payment happened at enrollment and update the payment_timestamp
UPDATE payment_table p
JOIN enrollment_table e ON p.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
SET p.payment_date = e.enrollment_timestamp
WHERE p.payment_date < e.enrollment_timestamp;
