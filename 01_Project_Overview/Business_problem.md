# Business Problem

## Background

The digital learning industry has witnessed rapid growth, with platforms such as Udemy and Coursera enabling individuals and organizations to access flexible, skill-based education. However, as the number of courses, instructors, and users increases, managing platform performance becomes increasingly complex.

For an e-learning marketplace to remain competitive and profitable, it is essential to monitor instructor productivity, course portfolio performance, pricing effectiveness, and student engagement. Without a structured Business Intelligence (BI) framework, decision-making becomes reactive and inefficient.

## Core Business Challenges

The platform currently faces several strategic and operational challenges:

### 1. Instructor Performance and Retention

Instructors are key revenue drivers. However, there is limited visibility into:

* Which instructors generate the highest business value.
* Whether some instructors are overloaded or underutilized.
* Reasons for declining activity or churn.
* Opportunities to retain high-performing instructors.

### 2. Course Portfolio Optimization

The platform hosts a large and growing course catalog. Key concerns include:

* Identifying underperforming or inactive courses.
* Detecting high-demand domains and emerging trends.
* Improving or removing low-engagement content.
* Ensuring the right balance between quality and variety.

### 3. Revenue and Pricing Strategy

The platform frequently uses discounts and promotional pricing. However:

* The impact of discounting on profitability is unclear.
* There is limited understanding of revenue contribution by category, course, and instructor.
* Opportunities for optimizing pricing and promotions are not fully leveraged.

### 4. Student Engagement and Platform Usage

Sustainable growth depends on student engagement. Key questions include:

* When is the platform most active?
* Which categories drive the highest engagement?
* Are there seasonal or behavioral patterns?
* How effectively are new users being converted?

## Objective of the BI System

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Business Intelligence system that enables data-driven decision-making by providing:

* Clear visibility into revenue drivers and business growth.
* Actionable insights into instructor performance and retention.
* Data-backed course portfolio and pricing strategies.
* Understanding of student behavior and engagement patterns.

The system integrates relational data modeling, SQL-based analytics, and Power BI dashboards to support strategic and operational decision-making in a scalable and structured manner.

## Expected Business Impact

By implementing this BI solution, the platform can:

* Improve instructor retention and productivity.
* Optimize the course catalog for higher engagement and revenue.
* Enhance pricing and promotional effectiveness.
* Identify growth opportunities through data-driven insights.
* Build a scalable analytical foundation for future expansion.

This project simulates a real-world business intelligence environment where data is used as a strategic asset to improve performance and long-term competitiveness.
