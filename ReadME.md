## E-Elearning Platform BI Analytics

This project involves developing an end-to-end Business Intelligence and Analytics solution for an E-Learning platform using data modeling, SQL, Python, and visualization tools. The workflow includes designing a relational database schema to maintain structured relationships across multiple entities. Synthetic datasets were generated with real-world complexity, including missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, to simulate practical data cleaning and preprocessing scenarios.

The project focuses to monitor platform performance across:
-revenue
-instructor effectiveness
-course portfolio health
-user engagment 
to gain useful insights and support data-driven decisions
